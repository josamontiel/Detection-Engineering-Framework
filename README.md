# 🙏 Acknowledgments & References

## 📚 Preface

The Detection Engineering Framework stands as a testament to the collective wisdom and expertise shared by the cybersecurity community. We extend our deepest gratitude to the organizations, researchers, and thought leaders whose pioneering work has laid the foundation for this comprehensive framework.

The development of this framework was develped during my position at Cisco as Cyber operations security architect and has been greatly influenced by the invaluable contributions from various Cisco colleagues, industry leaders, academic institutions, and security practitioners who have generously shared their insights, methodologies, and real-world experiences. Their dedication to advancing the field of cybersecurity and detection engineering has been instrumental in shaping the comprehensive approach presented in this framework.

We recognize that the strength of this Detection Engineering Framework comes not from a single source, but from the collaborative efforts of the entire cybersecurity ecosystem. Each reference and source listed below has contributed unique perspectives, proven methodologies, and practical insights that have been carefully integrated to create a holistic and actionable framework.

Our sincere appreciation goes to these organizations and researchers for their commitment to knowledge sharing and their continued efforts to elevate the standards of security operations and detection engineering practices worldwide.
