## 🔬 Contextual Feasibility Analysis

> ⚠️ Without the planning phase the development of the use cases could be **delayed**, **inaccurate** and could cause extended amount of **confusion** during the development phase.

It is important to understand the organisation's drivers or context behind the need for the use case as much as when the use cases are needed by and what resources would it need to build the use case. Such feasibility exercise is usually gathered in the form of an internal form which is then kept on record for historical record keeping and traceability purposes.

### 📋 Component Details

#### 🎯 **Objective**
> *Clearly defining the technical and organizational objectives of the use case*

Without well-defined objectives, the use case may lack focus and fail to address the organization's specific security needs. It is akin to embarking on a journey without a destination in mind. Without clear objectives, the development team may wander aimlessly, resulting in wasted time and resources, and potentially missing critical security threats.

#### 🚗 **Drivers**
> *Identifying the reasons and motivations behind developing the use case*

This helps provide context and ensure alignment with the organization's goals and priorities. Without a clear understanding of the drivers, the use case may not effectively address the organization's security challenges. An analogy could be driving a car without knowing the destination or purpose.

#### 🎪 **Scope**
> *Defining the assets (systems, data, applications, people, etc.) that need to be protected*

This is crucial for focusing development efforts and ensuring comprehensive coverage. Without a well-defined scope, the use case may either overlook critical assets or try to protect too many irrelevant elements. Imagine building a fence around a property without defining its boundaries.

#### 💡 **Purpose**
> *Describing the scope and value of the use case*

This helps establish its importance and justification. It provides a clear understanding of why the use case is needed and what benefits it brings to the organization. Without a clear purpose, the development team may struggle to prioritize the use case or communicate its value to stakeholders.

#### 💎 **Value**
> *Assessing the potential impacts of losing the identified assets or interrupting critical processes*

This helps prioritize use cases based on their potential impact. Understanding the value of protecting these assets is crucial for making informed decisions about resource allocation and risk management. Without assessing value, the development team may invest resources in less critical use cases while neglecting higher-priority ones.

#### ⚡ **Priority**
> *Determining the urgency and timeframe within which the use case needs to be developed*

This ensures that critical security needs are addressed promptly. It helps prevent delays and ensures that the most pressing risks are mitigated in a timely manner. Without prioritization, the development team may focus on low-impact use cases while neglecting those with higher urgency.

#### 👥 **Stakeholders**
> *Identifying the departments and stakeholders who have an interest in the use case*

This is vital for gathering input, ensuring alignment, and fostering collaboration. Involving relevant stakeholders promotes a sense of ownership and helps capture diverse perspectives. Without stakeholder involvement, the use case may lack input from critical areas, resulting in a solution that fails to meet their needs or gain their support.

#### 🤝 **Alignment**
> *Ensuring alignment with every relevant part of the organization*

This helps minimize conflicts, streamline integration, and optimize effectiveness. It allows for the smooth coordination of security operations with other business processes and ensures that the use case does not inadvertently disrupt existing workflows or systems.

#### 📈 **Outputs**
> *Defining the required outputs to measure and monitor the effectiveness of the use case*

This is essential for evaluating its performance and making informed decisions. It helps establish metrics, alerts, reports, or other deliverables that provide insights into the use case's efficacy. Without clear outputs, it becomes challenging to assess the impact and value of the use case.

#### 🛠️ **Resourcing**
> *Identifying the internal and extended resources required for the development phase*

This ensures that the necessary personnel, tools, and technologies are available to successfully implement the use case. It helps allocate resources effectively, preventing resource shortages or inadequate support. Without proper resourcing, the development team may lack the necessary expertise, tools, or infrastructure.

#### 📋 **Backlog**
> *Maintaining a list of prioritized use cases that need to be developed*

This allows for strategic planning and effective backlog management. It ensures that development efforts align with the organization's priorities and helps avoid ad-hoc decision-making or resource allocation. Without a backlog, the development team may struggle to prioritize and manage the development of multiple use cases.

    style I fill:#2C3E50,stroke:#85C1E9,stroke-width:1px,color:#FFFFFF
```

#### 🎯 Key Considerations

**📊 Priority Determination**
- Not all use cases have the same level of urgency or importance
- Some use cases may have impending deadlines, while others are critical to the organization's security posture or address imminent threats
- Balancing urgency and importance is essential

**📋 Backlog Management**
- Maintain a use case development backlog that should be regularly reviewed
- Each use case should be assigned scores for urgency and importance on a scale of 0 to 10
- By summing up these scores, you can rank the use case requests and identify the ones with the highest priority
- Begin development with the highest-scoring use cases and progressively move down the list
- In cases where there are multiple urgent and important requests, order them based on the level of effort required
